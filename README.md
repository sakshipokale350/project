PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------------------
This project is a desktop application developed using Python's Tkinter library for GUI and SQLite for database management. It allows the admin to manage courses, students, and results efficiently.

-------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:
-------------------------------------------
1. Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Copy the entire project folder from the CD to your computer.

3. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project folder:
   Example:
   > cd Desktop\Student_Result_Management_System

4. Run the application:
   > python main.py

5. The GUI will open. You can now manage courses, students, and results.

NOTES:
-------------------------------------------
- Do not delete the file `srms.db` â€“ it contains the student data.
- All `.py` files must be kept in the same folder.
- If any external Python libraries are required, use:
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
